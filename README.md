### Prerequisites

To get the project up and running you will have to Node.js installed. Once downloaded, this will automatically install NPM (Node Package Manager) on your computer as well.

### Getting Started

Once you have everything installed navigate to the app.js file and run the command

```
npm install
```
this will install all dependencies on to your local machine. Then run the command

```
node app.js -a "<your addres>"
```

An example of an address may be "Magaluf Spain" or "M60 7RA"

This will return your formatted address along with the temperature and apparent temperature. Alternatively you can run this command in the app2.js file as it will do the same thing. This file was just to demonstrate the differences of using a libary that by default does not support promises
